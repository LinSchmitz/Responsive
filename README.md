# Responsive

## ✅ What is Responsive Design?

Responsive design means your webpage adapts to different screen sizes (like mobile, tablet, laptop) — so it looks good everywhere.

### ✅ Step-by-Step Example

### ✅ How It Works:

Device Condition Style Change
💻 Laptop > 900px Fixed 1100px width and teal background
📱 Tablet <= 900px 90% width and yellow background
📞 Phone <= 600px 95% width, coral background, centered text

### ✅ Key Concepts

@media (max-width: ...) checks screen size.

Style inside media queries overwrites the default when the condition is true.

Use % for width inside media queries to make it fluid.
